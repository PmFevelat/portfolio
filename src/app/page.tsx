        I&apos;m Pierre-Marie, a student at HEC Paris and a founder at heart. You&apos;ll find more about me in the About section. This website showcases the projects I&apos;ve explored over the past months in search of my next startup â€” testing key assumptions as fast as possible, trying to build something people truly want.

      <Paragraph className="max-w-xl mt-4">
        Before building anything, I wanted to understand how companies actually buy â€” how they're prospected, how trust is earned, and how new solutions break through. That led me to explore the mechanics of software sales in depth. Along the way, I ran experiments that turned into projects â€” rethinking how we discover new tools in a world where traditional sales channels are saturated, marketing is biased, and word of mouth favors incumbents.

        This exploration naturally led me deeper into the sales & marketing space. I've since worked across the entire value chain â€” from positioning and sales enablement to buyer intelligence and win-loss analysis. It&apos;s an industry I'm excited to keep building in.
